    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Nikujaga</strong> or <strong>Japanese Meat and Potato Stew</strong> is a dish that is hearty and frequently eaten at home. The two main ingredients are <strong>niku</strong> (meat) and <strong>jaga</strong>imo (potatoes); it is a light, simmered dish. Potatoes make up the majority of the dish and other ingredients like onions, konnyaku and veggies are added in. The ingredients are stewed in soy sauce, sugar, sake, mirin and dashi. Once you learn how to make it, you can easily modify it to your liking.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large potatoes</li>
      <li>Thinly sliced beef or pork</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1 packet Shirataki konnyaku noodles</li>
      <li>2 carrots</li>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cups dashi</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp Mirin</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1.5 Tbsp sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Cut the sliced meat to 3 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Cut onions into wedges, chop carrots into 1 inch pieces, chop potatoes into quarters.</li>
        <li>If using snow peas, remove string. Blanche the snowpeas or whatever green veg you are using. Do not throw out the water.</li>
        <li>Drain shirataki noodles from package and chop them in half. Cook the noodles in the water used for blanching for 1 minute. Drain and set aside</li>
        <li>In a large stock pot, heat oil on medium and saute the onions. When the onions are coated with oil, add the meat and cook until it is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and coat them with the cooking liquid. The coating will prevent the potatoes from breaking</li>
        <li>Add carrot and shirtaki noodles, mix altogether</li>
        <li>Add enough dashi to just cover the ingredients. Cover to cook. Once boiling, add in the seasoning and mix.</li>
        <li>Simmer on low heat for 12-15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft. Do not mix the ingredients while cooking as this may cause it to break.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the pot stand for 30-60 minutes before serving. The flavours will soakinto the ingredients.</li>
